This study has presented a detailed examination of the deepfake detection capabilities of 
EfficientNet-B4 and XceptionNet models. Using two well-established datasets, Celeb-DF and 
FaceForensics++, both models demonstrated significant efficacy in distinguishing between 
real and fake videos, with EfficientNet-B4 generally outperforming XceptionNet. The use of
 AUC and log loss metrics provided a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance, 
 highlighting the strengths and areas for improvement.
Our findings underscore the importance of continual advancements in deepfake detection 
algorithms to keep pace with the rapidly evolving deepfake generation techniques. Future 
research should focus on integrating additional datasets, exploring other state-of-the-art 
CNN architectures, and refining preprocessing techniques to further enhance detection accuracy.
